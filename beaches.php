	    <br>
	    
	    <p class="text-justify">Sri Lanka is renowned for its stunning coastline, pristine beaches, and crystal-clear waters, making it a popular destination for beach lovers and water enthusiasts. The island's coastline stretches for about 1,340 kilometers (around 832 miles) and offers a diverse range of beach experiences.</p>

	            <h5 class="card-title">Nilaveli</h5>
	            <p class="card-text">Nilaveli Beach is a broad, sandy beach, lined with palm trees and dotted with fishermen's boats. Located on the northeast part of Sri Lanka, it's a 30-minute drive from the city of Trincomalee. This tiny island has calm beaches with gentle surf due to its own small reef. Although the beach at Nilaveli is large, it is popular with both locals and tourists. There are lifeguards on duty and many little restaurants along the beach, most specializing in seafood. The Trincomalee area is also good for sightseeing, as it's a center of Tamil culture. Tamil is the name of the language spoken in Sri Lanka and the ethnic group to which the majority of its residents belong. If the isolation of Nilaveli isn't enough, you can take a boat to Pigeon Island National Park, about a half-mile off the coast. </p>

	            <h5 class="card-title">Kalkudah</h5>
	            <p class="card-text">Kalkudah is a mile-long beach on Pasikuda Bay, just perfect for swimming and wading. The surf at Kalkudah is gentle, protected by a reef, unlike many beaches in Sri Lanka with rough surf. The water is also shallow, allowing you to walk out into the ocean for hundreds of yards. The sand is bright white and soft, with fine grains, and the beach is lined with coconut trees. This area is just starting to be discovered for luxury resort development, so there is still plenty of untouched beach to explore. For those who want a secluded getaway right on the water's edge, Karpaha Sands is an excellent accommodation option that is both affordable and packed with amenities. It's located on an uncrowded stretch of Kalkudah Beach.</p>

	            <h5 class="card-title">Arugam Bay</h5>
	            <p class="card-text">Arugam Bay is dramatically beautiful, with golden white sand and deep blue water gradually becoming green the closer you get to the shore. With that beauty comes some of the best surf breaks in Sri Lanka, and the beach is known as an international surf destination. This reputation brings many visitors but that also means the area has a good tourist infrastructure and is easy to access. The curving beach feels a bit like a Hawaiian beach â€” the area near the water slopes down, and there's a dry, sandy section, then rougher areas with shrubs and a tree line. Right on Arugam Bay, The Spice Trail is a cool, little luxury resort with individual villa accommodations.</p>

	            <h5 class="card-title">Mirissa</h5>
	            <p class="card-text">Mirissa is the largest fishing port on the south coast and sits right on the southern tip of the island. Its beauty and relative proximity to Colombo (the capital city) mean it's not hard to access. It's about a two-hour drive from the capital's airport. The small beach town and its large beach are beautiful, backed by a dense grove of palm trees. The town is on a little hill that rises up behind the beach. Mirissa Beach is arrow-shaped, with the arrow tip sticking out into the sea. This natural jetty also makes the surf calm and good for swimming. The beaches are bright white, with soft, fine sand, and the water is crystal clear. It's light green where the bottom is sandy and dark blue where there are rocks or reef.</p>

	            <h5 class="card-title">Unawatuna</h5>
	            <p class="card-text">Unawatuna and its beach are near the colonial town of Galle, which is a great city for sightseeing. Sri Lanka was formerly a colony of both Portugal and Holland (at different times), and this was the country's main city during that time. About five kilometers outside Galle, Unawatuna offers another little bit of beach paradise. The area, also a big destination for ecotourism, has a large coral reef offshore. The beach is large and curving but can be crowded as it's considered one of the country's best beach resorts. CoCo Bay Unawatuna is a well-appointed beachfront resort with its own little private section of the beach (with great views of Galle Fort) with lounge chairs.</p>

	            <p class="card-text">Bentota is a popular resort town, only an hour from Colombo. Because it's so close to the capital, Bentota sees many package tourists but retains its spectacular natural beauty and is worth a visit. The sand is bright white on this wide beach, and the sea is bright aqua-blue due to its light-colored sandy bottom. The beach is surrounded by jungle and tall palm trees. Nearby attractions include many temples and remnants of the country's colonial past, like a fort protecting the old harbor of Galle. The Taj Bentota Resort &amp; Spa, part of the Indian Taj hotel chain, is a large luxury resort with some rooms and suites overlooking the sea.</p>
